<h2 id="new-to-ismir-mentoring-program">New-to-ISMIR mentoring program</h2>

<p>The New-to-ISMIR paper mentoring program is designed for members new to ISMIR (early stage researchers in MIR or researchers from allied fields who wish to consider submitting their work to an ISMIR conference) to share their advanced-stage work-in-progress ISMIR paper drafts with senior members of the ISMIR community (mentors) to obtain focused reviews and constructive feedback. The program supplements the generic submission guidelines. The program is being run as a pilot in 2022, closely aligned with the ISMIR 2022 paper submissions deadlines.</p>

<h2 id="important-features-of-the-program">Important features of the Program</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The mentorship program encourages early stage researchers or researchers from other allied fields who wish to submit their work to ISMIR conference to share their advanced stage work-in-progress ISMIR paper submissions with senior members of the ISMIR community to obtain focused reviews and constructive feedback. The topics of the paper are expected to be in alignment with the topics of ISMIR conferences.</li>
  <li>The mentees are expected to apply to the program with a tentative abstract and submit an advanced-stage draft of the paper by the published deadlines (see below Important Dates).</li>
  <li>A mentor will be assigned to each mentee paper in the program and will provide a detailed review and constructive feedback to improve the work and the paper quality for suitability in an ISMIR conference. The mentor will maintain confidentiality of the discussions and the unpublished work as agreed with the mentees. The mentor will be available for up to two cycles of review/feedback on the mentee paper revisions, and up to two discussion meetings (up to an hour each).</li>
  <li>Mentee authors get one cycle of review (authors submit, mentors provide a review) but are optionally encouraged to participate in an additional cycle where the authors incorporate the suggestions and mentor reviews the revised paper. Mentees are expected to provide additional information on their work, if requested by the mentor to provide better feedback.</li>
  <li>We strongly encourage the mentored papers to be revised based on the feedback and submitted to the upcoming ISMIR 2022 conference. All mentored papers, if submitted to ISMIR 2022, will go through the usual process of review without any exceptions. Both mentors and mentees agree to clearly declare conflict of interests when the mentored papers are submitted to the ISMIR conference to facilitate double-blind review process.</li>
  <li>In this pilot program, we will be able to support a limited number of papers for mentorship due to capacity constraints. If we receive more requests than we can support, we will prioritize papers considering authors’ needs and/or topics that fall under the special call for papers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<p>The proposed authors of the papers submitted to the mentoring program must satisfy all the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The authors are planning for a submission to an ISMIR conference on a topic aligned with the ISMIR conference.</li>
  <li>The proposed first author of the paper has no previously published papers in ISMIR conferences.</li>
  <li>None of the proposed co-authors of the paper have ever been meta-reviewers for ISMIR conferences.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[<del>Feb 25</del> Feb 28] Deadline for applying to mentorship program with a tentative abstract and topics of the paper</li>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>Applications to the program must include a tentative title, author list and an abstract (200 words).</p>

<p>The papers submitted to the program should be an advanced-stage draft of the paper. To get maximum benefit out of the mentoring program, please ensure the work is as complete as possible and avoid incomplete submissions lacking sufficient detail. The papers should strictly follow ISMIR conference submission guidelines, outlined in the ISMIR 2022 Call for Papers: <a href="https://ismir2022.ismir.net/calls/cfp/">https://ismir2022.ismir.net/calls/cfp/</a>. Only exception would be that the papers should NOT be anonymized during the mentoring process since the paper mentoring program is not anonymous. The papers are to be uploaded on a channel whose details will be provided closer to the deadline. The submitted papers will be shared with the mentor assigned to each paper. Submissions that deviate from the guidelines will not be accepted for mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Q. How many papers are supported in the pilot program in 2022? Is there a chance that my application for mentorship might not be accommodated? 
<br /> <br /> <em>A. Since the program is in a pilot stage in 2022, the number of papers we support is limited by our current organisational capacity and availability of mentors. It may be possible that not all applications are accommodated if we receive a large number of requests. However, authors will know regarding acceptance of their applications before submitting papers to the program.</em> 
<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q. Who will be my mentor if I apply to the program? 
<br /> <br /> <em>A. Invited senior members from the MIR community have been kind enough to volunteer for the program. The mentors and mentees will be matched based on the topic of papers as chosen during submission and introduced to each other.</em>
<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q. If I incorporate all feedback from the mentor into my paper, will my paper be accepted for publication in the ISMIR conference? Is there a different review process for the mentored papers? 
<br /> <br /> <em>A. All mentored papers will go through the same review process as all other papers submitted to an ISMIR conference. There is no assurance that a mentored paper will be accepted to the conference.</em>
<br /></p>
  </li>
