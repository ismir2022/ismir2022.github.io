## Call for Tutorials
<br>

The 23rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2022) will be held in Bengaluru, India, from December 4th to 8th, 2022. It is currently planned to be in a hybrid format with the details to be finalized later. [https://ismir2022.ismir.net](https://ismir2022.ismir.net)

The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data. The 23rd ISMIR conference welcomes proposals for tutorials to be given in conjunction with the conference. Tutorials take place at the start of the ISMIR conference, and this year will be held on Sunday, Dec 4, 2022 in a hybrid format. Each tutorial is allocated 3 hours to concentrate on a single topic; tutorials take place in parallel sessions.

To make the conference more accessible and inclusive, in addition to the standard tutorial suggestions, we welcome tutorial proposals which either cover fundamental and introductory topics in MIR, or present an informative and stimulating coverage of current MIR topics in a manner that is targeted towards people new to the field. In particular, we would like to invite some under-represented topics such as dataset creation, copyright practices, towards cultural diversity and adaptation, multimodal learning, etc.
