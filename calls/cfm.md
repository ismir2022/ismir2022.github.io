## Themes
This year, music from any genre and in any formats is invited for submission. However, to make it a good fit for a hybrid format and make it more interesting, we propose the following themes that participants are encouraged to explore, but of course not limit to:
- **Recorded Ensemble:** Participants form teams to record ensemble performances to submit. (i) Networked offline — performers in different locations can pre-record each track and assemble it with others’ tracks by post editing, to perform as if the performances were played at the same time; (ii) Networked live — participants can also select to do a live performance using specialized audio streaming software (like Jacktrip, Soundjack) providing the audio to a multiple screen chat application like Zoom. The accepted submissions will be played back on-site as well as broadcast live.
- **Live Ensemble:** Participants form teams to compose ensemble performances that can be performed live. A recording of the edited ensemble has to be submitted for review, however, the accepted works will be performed live on-site and broadcast live.
- **Creative Visuals for Music:** Participants are encouraged to apply creative visual effects to accompany music. This includes but is not limited to AI-powered visual effects (e.g., facial distortion, video filtering) synced with music contents, animations or fictions, body performances, movements and gestures, etc.
- **Adaptations to Post-pandemic Era:** Participants are encouraged to create musical/sound art works that emphasizes the adaptations innovated during the mandated home studio setups with limited resources.
- **Cross-cultural Collaborations:** Participants are encouraged to create collaborations across music cultures where the collaboration is in an underlying theme of the allied lexicons. However, this has to be significantly different from a spontaneous jamming among performers, but to showcase a strong strategy of the collaboration.

## Concert
The concert program will be held in a hybrid format consisting of live performance for the on-site attendees and a live online streaming for the virtual attendees. Live comments will be enabled to encourage interactions. For broadcast of pre-recorded videos, performers are expected to be present to interact with audiences in the live chat window.

## Submission guidelines
The submission of music works should consist of:
- A submission proposal with description of the performance in the form of program notes (text) and technical rider (pdf)
- Video/audio performance of the piece, as .mp4, .mov, .wav, .aif, .flac format with file size < 100MB or an online link (preferably).
    - For non-live performance, the video file will be broadcast during the concert.
    - For live performance, please also submit a video/audio of a previous performance along with descriptions of implementation details of the live streaming.

After notification of acceptance, all participants have a chance to further edit the uploaded material to make a performance-ready submission. The video should be self-explanatory with some post-processed titles and subtitles, since there will be no commenter during the broadcast. Original audio submissions should be converted to video format with a meaningful visual component.

Only one submission per participant will be accepted. Pieces have to be shorter than 10 minutes. The submission is not anonymous. The proposals and video performances will be submitted through the CMT system for a light review. There is no guarantee that all submissions will be accepted for the program. Please note the submission proposal is for informative purposes for the selection and will not be included in the conference proceedings. The artist must hold the copyright of submitted materials to be used in ISMIR 2022.

_Submission site:_ [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2022](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2022)

Each accepted music submission needs to be covered by an in-person registration (student or full, as appropriate) by the early bird deadline(Aug 31, 2022). If the authors of the music submission are already ISMIR paper authors and have registered for the conference, their music submission can be covered with the same registration. Kindly indicate in the submission form if the first author of a submission is a student author.
