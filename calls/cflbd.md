# Call for Late-Breaking Demo

LBD session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers.

Those interested should follow the submission guidelines (see below) and submit extended abstracts through the system. The accepted abstracts must be presented by at least one author as a poster during the LBD session. Authors’ registration to the conference is mandatory but can be completed after the notification of acceptance. **Note that the LBD abstract is not a conference paper and will not be part of the official ISMIR 2022 proceedings**.

## Hybrid Conference

This year’s LBD will be held in a hybrid format, i.e., local and remote. There will be two sessions. The first will be focused on local participants. While the second will be remote only.

Due to organizational constraints we limit the submissions to 50. We also restrict submissions for local presentations to 20. Submissions will be accepted on a first-come first-served basis. However, we prioritize submissions that are to be presented locally.

## Important Dates

Submission open: August 15 (Mon), 2022

Submission deadline: December 2 (Fri), 2022
For people needing visas we strongly recommend submitting before October 14 (Mon), 2022.
