## The Quick Version
Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Participants are expected to engage in constructive, respectful, and inclusive conversations, and harassment of conference participants in any form will not be tolerated. Participants are expected to respect the privacy protocols of the conference. This Code of Conduct applies to all ISMIR 2022 activities including both physical and virtual events comprising talks, poster sessions, tutorials, workshops, social events, Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version
### Harassment
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, technology choices, posting of inappropriate sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention. Other forms of harassment for the virtual format of ISMIR 2022 include disrupting the virtual meeting (e.g., "zoom-bombing"), engaging in harm or threats of harm of any kind, and creating/contributing to a safety threat or unsafe or exclusionary situation.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsors should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
 
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
 
We expect participants to follow these rules at ISMIR 2022 conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
