         Prominent applications of Music Information Retrieval techniques have ranged from discovering new music 
  via recommendation frameworks to obtaining informative descriptions about a given piece of music, all of 
  which serve to enhance music listening experiences. The panel will discuss the huge potential of MIR research 
  in the context of the relevant current and future commercial products.

           While audio technology has always had an important role in music production, it is now recognised 
           that MIR tools can provide for workflows that enhance music creativity at every stage of the 
           journey. The panel will discuss the possibilities and challenges of this exciting partnership 
           between music computing and creativity.

           For the benefit of the remote attendees, ISMIR 2022 features online special sessions. 
           The sessions will be held at a time-zone suitable for virtual attendees from parts of the world 
           who may not find the hybrid conference time-zone (IST) convenient. The sessions will discuss 
           important topics in MIR and will be moderated by senior members of ISMIR community. 
            The sessions are open to all participants, and will be recorded and made available for watching them later.

         This special session will discuss an action plan towards a code of ethics for the ISMIR community. 
         A code of ethics represents a specific list of values and behaviors that a research community either 
         endorses or objects to. Codes of ethics have been established on the general level of engineering 
         associations (IEEE, ACM), but also more specifically by research communities such as{" "}                                                                                                      
         <span className="text-[#d83616]">

               NIME
            </a>
          </span>
          . Whereas ISMIR has seen a series of tutorials on ethics and values, and guidelines have been proposed ( 
            <span className="text-[#d83616]">
            <a href="https://ismir.net/resources/ethics/" target="_blank">
               https://ismir.net/resources/ethics/
            </a>
          </span>
            ), these attempts have not yet manifested into a official code of ethics.  Does ISMIR need such a code? 
            What is the function of the code? How can we establish and maintain such a code? What are the main 
          ethical concerns regarding ISMIR research and practice?

           Music information retrieval (MIR) is an exciting research field related to different disciplines, 
             including signal processing, machine learning, information retrieval, psychology, musicology, 
               and the digital humanities. This diversity opens up many opportunities for challenging, 
                 interdisciplinary, and fascinating research projects at the intersection of engineering and 
                 humanities. However, younger researchers can also feel overwhelmed by the variety and complexity of 
                 MIR research questions. In this session, we will have an informal exchange of ideas and experiences, 
                   inviting doctoral candidates and more experienced MIR researchers. Responding to questions from the 
                   audience, we hope this interactive session will be helpful for current PhD students and students considering a PhD in MIR.
