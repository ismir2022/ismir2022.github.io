          in Bengaluru, which is India’s first interactive music museum
          comprising hands-on interactive artifacts on different forms of music
          in India including art, folk and film music. The physical-only
          day-long informal workshop is planned to be a unique experience to
          introduce the MIR community to the diverse and rich music traditions
          of India through guided museum visits, short introductory workshops,
          an exhibition on contemporary Indian music, and informal interactions
          between invited experts and the members of the MIR community. Through
          the workshop, we hope to establish cross-disciplinary connections,
          initiate discussions and foster future collaborations on MIR for
          Indian music.
