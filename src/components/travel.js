It is safe to arrive in the city at night and several International flights arrive in Bengaluru in the middle of the night. Passengers can take a bus or taxi to the city from the airport. The airport has metered taxis operated by  KSTDC (Karnataka State Tourism Department), Meru or EasyCabs. These Airport Taxis are available 24/7 on all days – just outside the arrival gate. A special pink taxi service driven by women is also available exclusively for women. The airport also has a dedicated zone to take ridesharing taxis by Ola and Uber. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
        There are private taxi providers also available with whom a cab can be booked inside the airport, which will be slightly more expensive as compared to the radio/metered taxies. In addition, you could also arrange for airport transfers through your hotel, though it might be more expensive.

        <p className="text-lg">Bengaluru is supported by a system of metro, buses, taxis and autos for public transport.</p> 
        <p className="text-lg">Bangalore Metro (<span className="text-[#d83616]"><a href="https://english.bmrc.co.in/#/" target="_blank">Namma Metro</a></span>) is, clearly, the quickest, affordable and one of the best ways to get around Bengaluru. However, kindly confirm if the metro covers the place you want to visit. The nearest metro station to the venue (NSSC, IISc) is Sandal Soap Factory on the Green Line (2 km).</p>
        <p className="text-lg">The buses in Bengaluru are run by the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) with a fleet of ordinary buses (blue in color) and “Vajra”/”Vayu-Vajra'' air-conditioned buses. The buses have specific routes and no clear timetables are available. The bus fare is paid to the conductor upon boarding the bus and a ticket is collected. A day-pass that allows unlimited rides on the bus is available.</p>
        <p className="text-lg">Taxis are easily available in Bangalore with ride sharing apps Ola & Uber being the leading players.</p>
        <p className="text-lg">Auto-rickshaws (called autos or 3-wheelers in local lingo) are a common mode of transport and are readily available at every corner of the city. Please fix a fare before you start the ride when riding on autos. Autos are also available through the Ola ride sharing app.</p>
        <p className="text-lg">IISc is known as the “Tata Institute” among the common populace of the city, and could be used to refer to the institute when taking a taxi/auto/bus. Within IISc, most of the places could be reached on foot.</p>

          The information on this page is provided as general guidance for
          securing a visa to travel to India to attend the ISMIR 2022
          conference. The information provided cannot be constituted as legal
          advice. While the ISMIR 2022 organizers make every effort to keep the
          information up to date, we cannot make any guarantees about the
          accuracy or validity of the information.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">General Information</p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Visitors entering India must possess a passport valid for at least 6
          months after their date of entry into India. There should be at least
          two blank pages in the passport. An entry visa is essential for all
          those visiting India. There are several types of visas, including
          Conference, Tourist and Business Visas. Those traveling specifically
          for ISMIR 2022 are required to apply for a Conference Visa.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">When to Apply</p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          For most countries, the time taken by embassies to issue a Conference
          Visa is normally 14 days, and the visa is valid for three months from
          the date of issue by the embassy (not from the date of entry into
          India). For applications from citizens of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan,
          Sudan, Foreigners of Pakistani Origin and Stateless persons, the time
          taken is 60 days and the visa is valid for one month.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Share your Passport Details</p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          All participants who are non-Indian nationals will need to share their
          passport details so the ISMIR 2022 team can apply for necessary
          permissions from the concerned ministry. Visa Applicants from (1)
          Afghanistan, (2) Iraq, (3) Pakistan (4) Sudan (5) Foreigners of
          Pakistani Origin and (6) Stateless persons will need a special
          political clearance from Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          For participants from Pakistan: The port of entry into India should be
          Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai only. Hyderabad is not an allowed point of
          entry for Pakistani citizens. Pakistani citizens holding two passports
          should apply for a visa on their Pakistan passport.
