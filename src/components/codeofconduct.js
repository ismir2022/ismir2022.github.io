        <p className="text-lg">
          Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
          experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
          expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
          body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
          choices. Participants are expected to engage in constructive,
          respectful, and inclusive conversations, and harassment of conference
          participants in any form will not be tolerated. Participants are
          expected to respect the privacy protocols of the conference. This Code
          of Conduct applies to all ISMIR 2022 activities including both
          physical and virtual events comprising talks, poster sessions,
          tutorials, workshops, social events, Twitter, and other online media.
          Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
          expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the
          conference organizers.

        <p className="text-xl font-bold">The Less Quick Version</p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Harassment</p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
          gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
          physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality,
          religion, technology choices, posting of inappropriate sexual images,
          deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
          recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
          inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention. Other
          forms of harassment for the virtual format of ISMIR 2022 include
          disrupting the virtual meeting (e.g., “zoom-bombing”), engaging in
          harm or threats of harm of any kind, and creating/contributing to a
          safety threat or unsafe or exclusionary situation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
          particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or
          other material. Sponsors should not use sexualised
          clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised
          environment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference
          organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
          or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
          staff immediately.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue
          security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
          assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of
          the conference. We value your attendance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          We expect participants to follow these rules at ISMIR 2022 conference
          and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Given the hybrid nature of the conference, most of the scientific sessions of ISMIR 2022 events 
          will be livestreamed and also recorded. Participants will be alerted in the program and at events. 
          The audio and video recordings of such sessions made available to registered conference participants 
          are only for their viewing and cannot be shared further without the express consent of conference organizers
