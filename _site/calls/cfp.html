<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The 23rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2022) will be held in Bangalore, India, from December 4th to 8th, 2022. <a href="https://ismir2022.ismir.net">https://ismir2022.ismir.net</a></p>

<p>The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data. The 23rd ISMIR conference welcomes contributions related to any aspect of music information research, including foundations and theories for music processing, analysis, algorithms, evaluation, and applications.</p>

<p>ISMIR is a truly interdisciplinary research community, involving researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professionals from various disciplines such as computer science, electrical engineering, musicology, cognitive science, and library and information sciences. The ISMIR conference provides a venue for the exchange of ideas, issues, results, and perspectives among different profiles of people working with music and computing in a broad sense.</p>

<p>In addition to established research topics and tasks, ISMIR always welcomes brave new ideas and challenges. Submissions of novel music-related topics, tasks, and applications are highly encouraged to broaden the scope of ISMIR. ISMIR also has a tradition of publishing open datasets and open-source projects to enhance the scientific reproducibility, though ISMIR accepts submissions using proprietary datasets and implementations that are not sharable. ISMIR thus respects the diversity of academic disciplines, backgrounds, and approaches.</p>

<p>The accepted papers will be presented at the conference in a format to be decided.</p>

<h3 id="special-call-for-papers-cultural-and-social-diversity-in-mir">Special Call for Papers: Cultural and Social Diversity in MIR</h3>
<p>The research carried out in MIR nowadays does not reflect the rich variety of the world’s music traditions. MIR studies are mostly focused on international mainstream popular music, Western art music and other styles mainly based on tonal principles and global consumption practices. From ISMIR we want to promote the study of still under-represented music traditions in MIR. These traditions might not only present music characteristics that would require novel approaches even for standard MIR tasks, but can represent under-studied musical functions and communities. In this regard, we also encourage the study of new groups of music makers and users, as well as the development of tools that benefit beyond mainstream music communities. Equally, we encourage studies from a cross-cultural perspective that cater to this musical and cultural diversity. To submit to this track, authors should indicate this in the main submission form. These submissions will follow the same submission process and requirements described below, but dedicated meta-reviewers will be selected to oversee their review. An award will be given to the best paper accepted within this special call.</p>

<h3 id="selection-process">Selection Process</h3>
<p><em>Full paper review:</em> Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and a program committee member (meta-reviewer) who will overview the process and write a meta-review with a recommendation. The Scientific Program Chairs will make the final decision based on that recommendation.</p>

<p><em>Double blind review:</em> ISMIR follows a double-blind review process. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s).</p>

<p><em>Evaluation criteria:</em>  Evaluation criteria include scholarly/scientific quality, novelty of the paper, reusable insights, pioneering proposals, readability and paper organization, potential to generate discourse, and relevance of the topic to ISMIR. Papers which propose brave new ideas are valued. It is helpful to read the reviewer guidelines at <a href="https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines">https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines</a>, as well as the review form at <a href="https://ismir2022.ismir.net/reviewform">https://ismir2022.ismir.net/reviewform</a>, before the paper submission.</p>

<h3 id="submission-process">Submission Process</h3>
<p><em>Submission site:</em> <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2022/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2022/</a></p>

<p><em>Abstract submission:</em> The paper title, author names, contact details, and abstract must be submitted by the abstract submission deadline. The title and abstract, together with the selected subject area, are the primary sources for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.</p>

<p><em>Full paper submission:</em> The full paper must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline.</p>

<p><em>Supplementary material:</em> For the anonymous review process, in addition to the PDF file of the manuscript, authors may upload supplementary files for their submission, such as audio samples, demonstration videos, code, etc. These supplementary materials should comply with the requirements for the double-blind review process.</p>

<p><em>Subject area:</em> When submitting the abstracts, authors will be required to choose from the subject areas given. The list of subject areas is the one listed below and it will be available on the submission site.</p>

<p><em>Presenting authors:</em>  At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference, before the deadline given for author registration [TBD]. Failure to register before the deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the conference proceedings and program.</p>

<p><em>Publication:</em> Accepted papers will be published on the conference website and on an open access repository [TBD] using a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).</p>

<h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h3>
<p><em>Paper format:</em> Papers must be formatted using the ISMIR 2022 templates (<a href="https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates/tree/master/2022/latex">LaTeX</a>/<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/paper-template-for-ismir-2022/zqcwpbqntdsh">Overleaf</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates/tree/master/2022/word">Word</a>). Authors are required to submit their papers in PDF format. Submissions that manipulate the template (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review. All fonts need to be embedded within the PDF.</p>

<p><em>Paper length:</em> Papers must contain at most 6 pages of scientific content (including figures and tables), with additional optional pages that contain only references and acknowledgments. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.</p>

<p><em>Anonymity of authors:</em> Do not put your names under the title. Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). Check supplementary material for information that may reveal the authors’ identity. Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Anonymized materials may be uploaded as “Supplementary material”.</p>

<p><em>Preprints:</em> To maintain the legitimacy for our double-blind review process, we strongly discourage authors from posting near duplicate manuscripts on public archives (technical reports, arXiv, etc.). In the same spirit, to protect our double-blind review process, authors need to make sure they do not promote their work in any way during the review process (social media, blog, mailing-list, etc.), since this may prevent preserving anonymity.</p>

<p><em>External Materials:</em> If the paper promises to make the code, dataset, or other materials available after the acceptance, our research community relies on the research ethics of the authors to fulfill their promise.</p>
