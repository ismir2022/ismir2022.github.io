# Travel

This page will be updated with information to help you plan your travel to Bengaluru, India to attend ISMIR 2022. 

We will update the page with information on connectivity, visas, accommodation and more! Please watch this space for additional information. 

## VISA Information
The information on this page is provided as general guidance for securing a visa to travel to India to attend the ISMIR 2022 conference. The information provided cannot be constituted as legal advice. While the ISMIR 2022 organizers make every effort to keep the information up to date, we cannot make any guarantees about the accuracy or validity of the information.   
 
### General Information
Visitors entering India must possess a passport valid for at least 6 months after their date of entry into India. There should be at least two blank pages in the passport.
An entry visa is essential for all those visiting India. There are several types of visas, including Conference, Tourist and Business Visas. Those traveling specifically for ISMIR 2022 are required to apply for a Conference Visa.
 
### When to Apply
For most countries, the time taken by embassies to issue a Conference Visa is normally 14 days, and the visa is valid for three months from the date of issue by the embassy (not from the date of entry into India). For applications from citizens of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan, Foreigners of Pakistani Origin and Stateless persons, the time taken is 60 days and the visa is valid for one month.
 
### Share your Passport Details
All overseas participants must share their passport details so the ISMIR 2022 team can apply for a political clearance from the concerned ministry.
Visa Applicants from (1) Afghanistan, (2) Iraq, (3) Pakistan (4) Sudan (5) Foreigners of Pakistani Origin and (6) Stateless persons will need a special political clearance from Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India.
For participants from Pakistan:
The port of entry into India should be Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai only. Hyderabad is not an allowed point of entry for Pakistani citizens.
Pakistani citizens holding two passports should apply for a visa on their Pakistan passport.
 
### Fill the Visa Application Form
Indian Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions now require visa applications to be made online from the Indian Government website:  [https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/)
Please note that this website is operated by the Indian Government and not by the ISMIR 2022 organisers. Here are some tips on using that website:
Make a note of your temporary reference number. If the website gives error messages or freezes, you can try later using your temporary reference number to retrieve your partially filled form.
A visa application form will be generated with the High Commission Logo at the top. Print 2 copies (and another one for yourself) and sign. Save the document in case you need to reprint.
 
### Get your Supporting Documents
The supporting documents required for a visa application are:
Two passport-size photographs
Letter of identification from your institution or employer
Confirmed onward & return tickets (if applicable)
Letters of permission from Indian Government Ministries for holding the conference
Letter of Invitation from the conference organisers

You should obtain items 1 to 3 yourself. Details for items 4 and 5 will be provided on the conference website. All the documents should be submitted together to your nearest Indian Embassy or Consulate. All these documents are described in more detail below.
 
### Photographs
You will need to provide two 50 mm x 50 mm photos. Please ensure they are of your entire face from the top of your head to your chin, and that this distance measures between 25mm and 35mm. If this is not followed your application will be rejected.
 
### Letter from your Institution
This letter from the institution you are associated with should identify you and their relationship with you, and confirm that they understand that you intend to visit India for the Conference duration (plus any extra days for tourism).
 
### Invitation letter for the Conference
The ISMIR 2022 secretariat can provide an invitation letter for VISA purposes, if required. However, it does not guarantee you a visa OR might not be required by the consulate to process the VISA too. Hence kindly reconfirm before applying for the VISA with the consulate or your travel agent.
The invitation letter will be issued ONLY after you have registered and full payment has been received.
To obtain an invitation letter, please share the following details (these details are collected while registering to the conference);
- Name (as mentioned on the Passport):
- Passport Number:
- Place of Issue (Passport):
- Gender:
- Affiliation:
- Country

The above listed details should be exactly as it appears on your passport. Any differences could lead to a delay and/or denial of your visa. 
 
### Any Other documents required by Indian Embassies for Conference Visa
In addition to the documents described above, some embassies may require additional information. Please check the website of the Indian Embassy in your country under the heading ‘Conference Visa’.
The list of Indian diplomatic missions overseas can be consulted at: [http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/mission/mission](http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/mission/mission)
 
### Accompanying Persons
Accompanying Persons are not entitled to attend the conference technical sessions and should apply for a Tourist Visa. They can of course benefit from the events open to them and participate in the social events of the Conference.
The application process for Tourist Visa is much simpler than Conference Visa. No letter of invitation is required. Accompanying persons can use the e-Tourist visa facility at the website [https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html)
For a Tourist Visa, the purpose of visit should be stated as Tourism. Mentioning “Conference” on a Tourist Visa application is incorrect and will lead to the visa application being rejected.
Letters of invitation are issued only to delegates attending the Scientific Conference; not accompanying family persons.
 
### Enquiries
Enquiries can be sent to the conference secretariat at [ismir2022-registration@ismir.net](mailto:ismir2022-registration@ismir.net). We can help with information, but the organisers cannot influence the embassies in any way. It is the responsibility of the participant to get his/her visa.

### Important Note
Please note that the ISMIR 2022 oraganizing team is not authorized to assist or have any control over the VISA process beyond providing an Invitation Letter, that too post completion of the online registration process. Should your application be denied, the ISMIR 2022 team cannot change the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor will any member from the committee be able to engage in discussion or correspondence with the visa issuing authorities on behalf of the applicant.
The registration fee cannot be refunded for the reason of VISA being denied – cancellation policy mentioned on the website will be followed.
It takes around one month for the Embassy to process the VISA application, please register and apply for VISA as early as you can to make sure you have enough time to plan your trip.
