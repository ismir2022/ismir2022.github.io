# Financial Support

As a part of the commitments to foster diversity and inclusion, and to support early-career members of the ISMIR community, the [ISMIR Society](http://ismir.net/), [Women in MIR](http://www.ismir.net/wimir.html), and the local organizers offer several financial support opportunities for those who wish to attend ISMIR 2022, and those who may need extra support in order to be able to do this.
