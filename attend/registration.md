### FAQ
#### Q. My payment through a credit/debit card has been declined while paying in INR. Do I have any alternatives modes of payment?

A. We have been seeing some payment issues with credit cards that do not support second factor authentication and those from certain banks some of the times. In case you see any payment issues during registration with the INR denominated tickets, we suggest you to please register using the equivalent USD denominated ticket that are available on the registration portal, e.g. "Student (Virtual Participant) - Early Bird (USD)" instead of "Student (Virtual Participant) - Early Bird". The USD tickets are equivalent to the INR tickets and let you choose the same add-ons and options, except that they use a different payment processor and are expected to solve the issue with payment declines. 

#### Q. I have been provided with a discount code to register. How do I use the code and complete registration? 

A. Discount code you've been provided is personalized to you and is applicable to only specific categories of tickets. To register with this code, please visit the registration portal and enter the provided discount code in the "APPLY ACCESS/DISCOUNT CODE" box that you will see at the top right of the page. Once the code is applied, the waiver/grant is applied automatically to all eligible tickets. Please choose the category appropriate to you and continue with registration filling in all needed details.
